    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Gulab jamun is a popular Indian sweet made from milk solids, shaped into
      soft balls, deep-fried, and soaked in sugar syrup flavored with cardamom
      and rose water. It is commonly prepared during festivals, weddings, and
      special occasions. Gulab means “rose” (for the rose-flavored syrup) and
      jamun refers to the small round fruit it resembles.

    <h2>ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>For the Jamun Balls:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ghee (or melted butter)</li>
      <li>3–4 tablespoons milk (to make dough)</li>
      <li>Oil or ghee (for deep frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Sugar Syrup:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1½ cups sugar</li>
      <li>1½ cups water</li>
      <li>3–4 crushed cardamom pods</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon rose water (optional)</li>
      <li>A few saffron strands (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To prepare the sugar syrup, in a pan, add sugar and water. Heat until
        the sugar dissolves. Add crushed cardamom and let it boil for 5–7
        minutes. Turn off the heat and add rose water. Keep the syrup warm (not
        too thick).
      </li>
      <li>
        Next let's make the dough. In a bowl, mix milk powder, flour, and baking
        soda. Add ghee and mix well. Slowly add milk and knead into a soft,
        smooth dough. Do not over-knead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, shape the balls. Divide the dough into small portions. Roll into
        smooth balls without cracks.
      </li>
      <li>
        To fry the jamuns, heat oil or ghee on low-medium heat. Fry the balls
        slowly, stirring gently, until golden brown. Do not fry on high heat
        (they will brown outside but remain uncooked inside).
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, soak in syrup. Remove fried balls and place them directly into
        warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for at least 1–2 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
